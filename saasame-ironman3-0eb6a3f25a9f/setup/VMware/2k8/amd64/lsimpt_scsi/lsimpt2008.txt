.........................................................................
1.0 Introduction for Windows Server 2008  


Windows Server 2008 is an operating system designed to run on Intel
architecture (x86, 32-bit), Itanium Processor Family (IA64), and Extended-64
(x64, AMD64/EM64T) processors using current technology. It provides a graphical
user interface environment incorporating many high-level features. Refer to the
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 documentation for details.

An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows Server 2008. To address a
peripheral, the I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Windows
Server 2008 provides class drivers for hard disk, optical, CD-ROM, printer,
and scanner peripherals. Other class drivers, provided by peripheral
manufacturers, may be added to support new devices. Tape device support is
built into the operating system itself and does not require a class driver. 

Microsoft provides the port driver and LSI Corporation provides the miniport
drivers, which are called LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS.  These
drivers complete the path to the LSI controller or processor with an optional
U320 SCSI, Fibre Channel or SAS BIOS.

These miniport drivers use the Microsoft StorPort port driver (rather than
the Microsoft ScsiPort driver in earlier versions of Windows).  The StorPort
driver has architectural enhancements that provide performance improvements on
large server systems with many storage adapters.  These miniport drivers are
designed to take advantage of these enhancements for improved performance.

.........................................................................
1.1 Features

1.3 Description

The LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers meet the Microsoft
specification for miniport drivers.  These drivers allow connection of
parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel and SAS devices including disk drives, CD-ROMs,
and tape drives for PCI and PCI-X based machines. To support a different
parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel or SAS device type, the Windows Server 2008
architecture requires that a class driver for that type of device be present
(usually supplied by Microsoft, or possibly by the peripheral manufacturer).
No changes to the LSI drivers are required. The driver supports only Windows
Server 2008 and all subsequent Service Packs. 

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to the parallel SCSI,
Fibre Channel or SAS Protocol devices by using the SCSI pass-through facility.
This facility allows applications to directly control and access devices by
filling in a data structure and calling into the port or class driver. Refer
to the Microsoft Windows Server 2008 documentation for more details.

............................................................................
2.0 Installing the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS Drivers


This procedure installs the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers
onto a new or existing Windows Server 2008 system. Depending upon the media
used to distribute LSI drivers (web or CD-ROM) and the type of adapter, you
will create a driver install package on some type of accessible media.  This
can be a diskette, CD or DVD, or USB flash drive.  The driver install package
can also be placed on a hard disk for driver upgrades only.

Select the driver package that matches the adapter type and processor
architecture. Copy the files listed in this section to a folder on the desired
media as shown below. You will use this driver package during the installation
process.

For LSI_SCSI:
        lsi_scsi.inf
        lsi_scsi.sys
        pvlhx86.cat (for x86) or
        pvlhia64.cat (for IA64) or
        pvlhx64.cat (for x64)
        
For LSI_FC:
        lsi_fc.inf
        lsi_fc.sys
        fvlhx86.cat (for x86) or
        fvlhia64.cat (for IA64) or
        fvlhx64.cat (for x64)
        
For LSI_SAS:
        lsi_sas.inf
        lsi_sas.sys
        svlhx86.cat (for x86) or
        svlhia64.cat (for IA64) or
        svlhx64.cat (for x64)
        
For the following driver installation sections, the designation LSI_xxx is used
to indicate the LSI_SCSI, LSI_FC or LSI_SAS driver, depending on which driver
is being installed.

Note: Windows Server 2008 drivers must be either Release signed (by LSI) or
      WHQL logo signed (by Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs) to be
      installed on Server 2008.  Any modifications to any of the above files
      will invalidate the digital signature of the package and Server 2008 will
      not install the driver.

............................................................................
2.1 New System Installation 

This procedure installs the LSI_xxx.SYS driver onto a Windows Server 2008
system. Use this procedure when installing Windows Server 2008 onto an unused
drive. Windows Server 2008 automatically adds the driver to the registry and
copies the driver to the driver storage area.

Note: Windows Server 2008 contains bundled LSI_SCSI, LSI_FC and LSI_SAS
      drivers. These drivers will support a fresh installation of Server 2008.
      If a newer driver is to be installed, the fresh installation can be done
      with the bundled driver and the driver can be upgraded after installation
      has completed as described in Section 2.2.  Or, the newer driver can be
      used for fresh installation as described in the following section.

............................................................................
2.1.1 DVD-ROM Installation

1. Start the Windows Server 2008 installation by booting from the Windows
   Server 2008 DVD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a DVD-ROM. BIOS settings may need
   to be changed to allow DVD-ROM booting.
   
2. Process with the installation of Windows Server 2008. When the screen
   displays "Where do you want to install Windows?", click on the Load Driver

............................................................................
2.3 Performance Tuning for Windows Server 2008

Windows Server 2008 has registry entries that can be used to tune the
performance of SCSI I/O for certain configurations. The registry settings of
NumberOfRequests and MaximumSGList are not used by StorPort and will have no
effect on the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers.

............................................................................
2.3.1 Miniport Driver Configuration Options

The LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers are configured by default
to provide optimum performance in most standard systems.

............................................................................
2.4 WinPE Installation

WinPE is provided to system OEM's to create a Pre-install Environment image.
To use the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS or LSI_SAS.SYS driver with the Windows
Server 2008 based WinPE, perform the steps listed below.  This example uses the
LSI_SAS.SYS driver.  Substitute the proper driver name for the other drivers.

1. Create an lsi_sas folder in the winpe_image directory under i386\system32.
   For example: mkdir winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas
 
2. Copy the lsi_sas driver package to the winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas
   folder.

3. Edit the winpe_image\i386\System32\Winpeoem.sif to remove the semicolons
   from the [OemDriverParams] section and add the name of the lsi_sas
   directory to the OemDriverDirs entry. For example:

   [OemDriverParams]
   OemDriverRoot = ""
   OemDriverDirs = lsi_sas
 
4. You can then use oscdimg to create a bootable .iso image, or follow the
   WinPE User’s Guide to create a bootable USB flash device.

............................................................................
3.0 Troubleshooting 

The LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS driver will log error messages to
the system error log. For these errors, the system errorlog EventID will be 11,
and the specific error code values will be displayed at offset 0x10. Data
should be displayed in words.
