.........................................................................
1.0 Introduction for Windows Server 2003  


Windows Server 2003 is an operating system designed to run on Intel 
architecture (x86, 32-bit), Itanium Processor Family (IA64), and Extended-64
(x64, AMD64/EM64T) processors using current technology. It provides a graphical
user interface environment incorporating many high-level features. Refer to the
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 documentation for details.

An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows Server 2003. To address a
peripheral, the I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Windows
Server 2003 provides class drivers for hard disk, optical, CD-ROM, printer,
and scanner peripherals. Other class drivers, provided by peripheral
manufacturers, may be added to support new devices. Tape device support is
built into the operating system itself and does not require a class driver. 

Microsoft provides the port driver and LSI Corporation provides the miniport
drivers, which are called LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS.  These
drivers complete the path to the LSI controller or processor with an optional
U320 SCSI, Fibre Channel or SAS BIOS.

These miniport drivers use the Microsoft StorPort port driver (rather than
the Microsoft ScsiPort driver in earlier versions of Windows).  The StorPort
driver has architectural enhancements that provide performance improvements on
large server systems with many storage adapters.  These miniport drivers are
designed to take advantage of these enhancements for improved performance.

.........................................................................
1.1 Features 

The LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS miniport drivers support these
features:

.........................................................................
1.3 Description

The LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers meet the Microsoft
specification for miniport drivers.  These drivers allow connection of
parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel and SAS devices including disk drives, CD-ROMs,
and tape drives for PCI and PCI-X based machines. To support a different
parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel or SAS device type, the Windows Server 2003
architecture requires that a class driver for that type of device be present
(usually supplied by Microsoft, or possibly by the peripheral manufacturer).
No changes to the LSI drivers are required. The driver supports only Windows
Server 2003 and all subsequent Service Packs. 

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to the parallel SCSI,
Fibre Channel or SAS Protocol devices by using the SCSI pass-through facility.
This facility allows applications to directly control and access devices by
filling in a data structure and calling into the port or class driver. Refer
to the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 documentation for more details.

............................................................................
2.0 Installing the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS Drivers


This procedure installs the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers
onto a new or existing Windows Server 2003 system. Depending upon the media
used to distribute LSI drivers (web or CD-ROM) and the type of adapter, you
will create a driver diskette.

Copy the files listed in this section to the root directory of a clean
diskette as shown below.  Label this diskette "Windows Server 2003 Driver
Diskette". You will use this diskette during the installation process.

For LSI_SCSI:
        txtsetup.oem
        lsi_scsi.tag
        lsi_scsi.inf
        lsi_scsi.sys
        p2k332.cat (for x86) or
        p2k3ia64.cat (for IA64) or
        p2k3am64.cat (for x64)
        
For LSI_FC:
        txtsetup.oem
        lsi_fc.tag
        lsi_fc.inf
        lsi_fc.sys
        f2k332.cat (for x86) or
        f2k3ia64.cat (for IA64) or
        f2k3am64.cat (for x64)
        
For LSI_SAS:
        txtsetup.oem
        lsi_sas.tag
        lsi_sas.inf
        lsi_sas.sys
        s2k332.cat (for x86) or
        s2k3ia64.cat (for IA64) or
        s2k3am64.cat (for x64)
        
For a driver upgrade the driver files can also be copied onto a hard drive,
CD or DVD, or a USB flash drive.
        
For the following driver installation sections, the designation LSI_xxx is used
to indicate the LSI_SCSI, LSI_FC or LSI_SAS driver, depending on which driver
is being installed.

............................................................................
2.1 New System Installation 

This procedure installs the LSI_xxx.SYS driver onto a Windows Server 2003
system. Use this procedure when installing Windows Server 2003 onto an unused
drive. Windows Server 2003 automatically adds the driver to the registry and
copies the driver to the appropriate directory.

Note: Windows Server 2003 contains a SYMMPI.SYS driver that supports the
      U320, 919 and 929 devices.  When performing a fresh installation with a
      device that is supported by the bundled SYMMPI.SYS driver, loading
      of the LSI_xxx.SYS driver using the F6 key will have no effect and
      the SYMMPI.SYS driver will be used.  To use the LSI_xxx.SYS driver,
      upgrade the driver after installation has completed as described
      in Section 2.2.

The method for installing Windows Server 2003 on a new system involves using
a CD-ROM. Installation using boot floppy diskettes is not supported by
Windows Server 2003.

............................................................................
2.1.1 CD-ROM Installation

1. Start the Windows Server 2003 installation by booting from the Windows
   Server 2003 CD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a CD-ROM. BIOS settings may need
   to be changed to allow CD-ROM booting.

2. Press the F6 key to install the LSI_xxx.SYS driver when the screen displays
   "Windows Setup".

   This must be done or else the new driver will not be recognized.

   Note: Be sure to press the F6 key as any driver loaded later in the
         installation process is not recognized by Windows Server 2003 Setup.
         If F6 is not pressed, all devices controlled by the drivers are
         not available during Windows Server 2003 setup.

3. Choose S to specify an additional device when the screen displays "Setup
   could not determine the type of one or more mass storage devices...". 

   NOTE: If this screen is not displayed as the first user input, then 
         pressing the F6 key was not seen by the setup program. Reboot the 
         system and try again.

   The system prompts for the manufacturer-supplied hardware support disk.

4. Insert the appropriate driver diskette containing the Windows Server 2003
   driver required to support your LSI adapter(s) and press Enter.
    
   Note: Current Windows Server 2003 drivers can be downloaded from the
         LSI Corporation web site at:
             http://www.lsi.com/cm/DownloadSearch.do
         After you are connected to this web site, select the product
         category, family, and the appropriate product.  Select the desired
         Windows 2003 driver to begin the download.

5. The screen will display one entry to select, depending on the system
   platform (x86, IA64, or x64):

       "LSI Fusion-MPT xxx Driver (Server 2003 32-bit)"
       
       or

       "LSI Fusion-MPT xxx Driver (Server 2003 IA64)"
       
       or

       "LSI Fusion-MPT xxx Driver (Server 2003 x64)"
       
       (where xxx is U320, FC, or SAS depending on the driver beign installed)
   
   Verify the driver displayed matches the processor architecture of the
   system (32-bit, IA64 or x64). Press Enter to proceed.

   Return to the Windows Server 2003 Setup screen.

6. Press Enter to proceed.

   The message about setup loading files appears.

7. Follow the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 installation procedure
   at this point.

............................................................................
2.2 Existing System Installation

This procedure installs or upgrades the LSI_xxx.SYS drivers onto an existing
Windows Server 2003 system.

NOTE: When a LSI SCSI, Fibre Channel or SAS adapter is added to an existing
	  system installation, the new adapter is automatically detected at the
	  next reboot. When the Device Driver Wizard appears at boot, click on the
	  Next button and continue at step 8 below.

1. Boot Windows Server 2003 and logon as a user that has Administrator
   privileges.

2. Click on the Start button, then right-click on the My Computer entry in
   the menu.

3. Click on the Properties selection.

4. Click on the Hardware tab, and then the Device Manager button.

5. Click the "+" to the left of the SCSI and RAID controllers line.  Find the
   adapter desired for the driver upgrade and double-click the entry.  Click
   on the Driver tab.

6. Information on the currently installed driver is displayed, and additional
   driver details can be viewed by clicking the "Driver Details" button.

7. Click on the "Update Driver" button to update the existing driver.  The
   Hardware Update Wizard begins.
   
8. Click on the "Install from a list or specific location..." button to select
   it, then click on the Next button.

9. Click on the "Don't search, I will choose the driver to install." button
   to select it, then click on the Next button.

10. Click on the "Have Disk" button and type the path to the driver, or click
    on the Browse button. Select the location for the driver package which
    matches the processor architecture of the system (x86, IA64, or x64). After
    the path to the driver has been established, click the OK button.

11. Select the driver from the list and click on the Next button.

12. Click on the Next button again to start the driver update.

    In some cases, a message will display saying that this driver has not
    passed logo testing. This message informs you that a nonsigned driver is
    being installed.

    Note: Drivers are digitally signed by the Microsoft Windows Hardware
          Quality Lab (WHQL) on completion of logo testing.  Due to the time
          lag between the general customer release by LSI of Windows drivers
          and the completion of WHQL logo testing, some drivers distributed
          with adapters or downloaded from the www.lsi.com web site may not be
		  digitally signed.

13. Click STOP Installation to cancel the installation if a nonsigned driver
    is not desired.

      or

    Click Continue Anyway to continue the installation.

    The system will load the driver from the Windows Server 2003 driver
    diskette. A message box may display indicating that the target (existing)
    driver is newer than the source (upgrade) driver.

14. Click No to cancel the driver upgrade at this point.

      or

    Click Yes to continue the installation.

    The system copies the driver to the system disk. For any adapter other
    than the boot adapter, the updated driver will become active immediately.
    For the boot adapter, a message box displays indicating that you must
    reboot your system for the new driver to take effect.

15. Click on the Finish button to complete the driver upgrade.

............................................................................
2.3 Performance Tuning for Windows Server 2003

Windows Server 2003 has registry entries that can be used to tune the
performance of SCSI I/O for certain configurations. The registry settings of
NumberOfRequests and MaximumSGList are not used by StorPort and will have no
effect on the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers.

............................................................................
2.3.1 Miniport Driver Configuration Options

The LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS drivers are configured by default
to provide optimum performance in most standard systems.

............................................................................
2.4 WinPE Installation

WinPE is provided to system OEM's to create a Pre-install Environment image.
To use the LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS or LSI_SAS.SYS driver with the Windows
Server 2003 based WinPE, perform the steps listed below.  This example uses the
LSI_SAS.SYS driver.  Substitute the proper driver name for the other drivers.

1. Create an lsi_sas folder in the winpe_image directory under i386\system32.
   For example: mkdir winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas
 
2. Copy the lsi_sas driver package to the winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas
   folder.

3. Edit the winpe_image\i386\System32\Winpeoem.sif to remove the semicolons
   from the [OemDriverParams] section and add the name of the lsi_sas
   directory to the OemDriverDirs entry. For example:

   [OemDriverParams]
   OemDriverRoot = ""
   OemDriverDirs = lsi_sas
 
4. You can then use oscdimg to create a bootable .iso image, or follow the
   WinPE User’s Guide to create a bootable USB flash device.

............................................................................
3.0 Troubleshooting 

The LSI_SCSI.SYS, LSI_FC.SYS and LSI_SAS.SYS driver will log error messages to
the system error log. For these errors, the system errorlog EventID will be 11,
and the specific error code values will be displayed at offset 0x10. Data
should be displayed in words.
