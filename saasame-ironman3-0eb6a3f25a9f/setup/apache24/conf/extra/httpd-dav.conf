# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)
#
# Required modules: mod_dav, mod_dav_fs, mod_setenvif, mod_alias
#                   mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_file, mod_authz_user
#

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.

DavLockDB "${SRVROOT}/web-dav/DavLock"

Alias /webDav "${WEBROOT}/imagex"

<Location "/webDav">
	DAV On
	AuthType basic
	AuthName "RestrictedAccess"
	AuthUserFile "${SRVROOT}/web-dav/.htaccess"
	Require valid-user
</Location>

#
# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a 
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle 
# redirects for folders with DAV methods.
