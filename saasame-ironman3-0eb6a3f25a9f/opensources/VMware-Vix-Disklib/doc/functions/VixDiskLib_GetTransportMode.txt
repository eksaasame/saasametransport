VixDiskLib_GetTransportMode

[description]
[code]
const char *
VixDiskLib_GetTransportMode(VixDiskLibHandle diskHandle);
[endcode]

Returns a pointer to a static string identifying the transport mode that
is used to access the virtual disk's data.

If a disk was opened through a connection obtained by VixDiskLib_Connect(),
the return value is "file" for a hosted disk and "nbd" for a managed disk.

[parameters]
   diskHandle - Handle to an open virtual disk.

[return]
Returns a static string identifying the transport mode used to open the disk.
Returns NULL if diskHandle is a NULL handle.

[remarks]
* A list of known transport modes is returned by VixDiskLib_ListTransportModes().
* The "file" and "nbd" modes are built into VixDiskLib so they are always recognized.
* Calling VixDiskLib_ConnectEx() instead of VixDiskLib_Connect() enables a wider range
  of transport modes, some of which result in better I/O performance when accessing
  managed disks on shared storage or when running inside a virtual machine.

[example]
[code]
   printf("Using transport mode: %s\n", VixDiskLib_GetTransportMode(diskHandle));
[endcode]
