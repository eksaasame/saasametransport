I) Installation

1) Substitute your daemon’s name for “mydaemon”.

sudo cp /etc/init.d/skeleton /etc/init.d/mydaemon
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/mydaemon
sudo vi /etc/init.d/mydaemon

2) Update your start/stop script.

PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin
DESC="Description of the service"
NAME=daemonexecutablename
DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME
DAEMON_ARGS="--options args"
PIDFILE=/var/run/$NAME.pid
SCRIPTNAME=/etc/init.d/$NAME

Update DESC to a meaningful description of your daemon.
Update NAME to the exact name of your daemon.

3) Update your daemon to exec.

sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/mydaemon

II) Management

a) Run your Daemon

sudo /etc/init.d/mydaemon start

b) Stop your Daemon

sudo /etc/init.d/mydaemon stop

c) Restart your Daemon

sudo /etc/init.d/mydaemon restart

d) Automatically Start your Daemon

This command tells your system to start your daemon automatically when the system starts:

update-rc.d mydaemon defaults 99

To keep your daemon from starting, if needed:

update-rc.d -f mydaemon remove

List running daemons

e) Well-behaved daemons generally create a PID file in /var/run/. List that directory and your have a fair list of running daemons.

sudo ls /var/run/

f) Get PID for a particular daemon

If you know the name of a daemon and want to see if it is running and get its PID, use pgrep.

pgrep mydaemon

g) Also useful is the ps command, which list processes.

ps aux

The aux switch limits output to processes not associated with a terminal.

h) Show programs running as daemons

This line attempts to show programs that are running as daemons.

which `ps aux | cut -c 66- | cut -d\  -f 1` | sort | uniq
