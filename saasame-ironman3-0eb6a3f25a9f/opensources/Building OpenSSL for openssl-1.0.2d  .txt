@mattcaswell I got it to work (1.0.2h) by using NASM - like people above said.

Here's exactly what to do:

Extract the source code to a new clean folder - failed appempts seem to leave a lot of crap

Download Nasm.exe if you don't already have it - http://www.nasm.us/. Just put it in C:\Windows\System32 (or in your path) // << Download the win32 version >>

Start the VS2012 X86 Command prompt - and run the following:

"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=C:\Build-OpenSSL-VC-32
ms\do_nasm.bat
nmake -f ms\nt.mak
nmake -f ms\nt.mak install
